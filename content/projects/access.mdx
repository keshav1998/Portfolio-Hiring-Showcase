## Project Structure

The project is structured around a main component, `ProfileCreator`. This component is responsible for the creation and auto-filling of profiles. It takes as input the path to a pitch deck PDF and a website name, and outputs a fully filled profile. The system uses Qdrant quick embeddings to create embeddings out of pitch decks and text extracted from the website.
