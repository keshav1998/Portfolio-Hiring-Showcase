This project is an advanced automated solution designed to streamline the process of profile creation. It is built with a focus on reducing manual entry and enhancing efficiency. The system is designed to be fully automated and utilizes advanced technologies such as Chain of Thought Prompting and Qdrant DB for embedding storage.

- Fully automated
- Structured design
- Reduces manual entry
- Utilizes Chain of Thought Prompting
- Uses Qdrant DB for embedding storage

## Project Structure

The project is structured around a main component, `ProfileCreator`. This component is responsible for the creation and auto-filling of profiles. It takes as input the path to a pitch deck PDF and a website name, and outputs a fully filled profile. The system uses Qdrant quick embeddings to create embeddings out of pitch decks and text extracted from the website.

```ts
import { ProfileCreator } from "your-repo/startup-profile-creation";

/**
 * Define the pitch deck PDF and website name
 */
const pitchDeck = "path-to-your-pitch-deck.pdf";
const websiteName = "your-website-name";

/**
 * Create a ProfileCreator instance
 */
const pc = new ProfileCreator();

/**
 * Now you can auto-fill a profile by specifying the pitch deck and website name
 */
const profile = pc.createProfile(pitchDeck, websiteName);

/**
 * The profile is now created and filled with information extracted from the pitch deck and website
 * The system uses Qdrant quick embeddings to create embeddings out of pitch decks and text extracted from the website
 */
console.log(profile);
```
