This is my personal portfolio website. It is designed to showcase my projects, skills, and experience. The website is built using React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS. It features a clean and modern design, with a focus on usability and accessibility. The website is fully responsive and works well on all devices.
The website is completely inspired from [Chronark](https://chronark.com) and is a fork of the same. I really liked the design and the way the website was structured. I have made some changes to the website to make it more personalized and to showcase my projects and skills.
