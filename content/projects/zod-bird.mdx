title: "Covid Detection CV model"
description: Developed a robust component SDK for a pharmaceutical company, enabling efficient analysis of COVID-19 test videos. Utilized advanced computer vision techniques to perform object detection in the videos, employing YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 models. Implemented a custom ratio value for alignment, ensuring accurate object alignment based on orientation. Incorporated a VGG-based model for classification, enabling further analysis and insights on the detected objects. Leveraged the Roboflow platform for data annotation, ensuring accurate and comprehensive labeling of the video frames.
